AI Vacuum Cleaner using A* Search

This repository contains an implementation of an AI vacuum cleaner programmed to efficiently navigate through a grid environment, pick up dirt or toys, and avoid obstacles using the A* search algorithm.

Features:

  - A Search Algorithm*: The vacuum cleaner employs the A* search algorithm to find the optimal path through the grid environment, ensuring efficient navigation while avoiding obstacles.
  - Goal-oriented Cleaning: The primary objective of the vacuum cleaner is to pick up all dirt or toys within the environment while minimizing travel distance and avoiding collisions with obstacles.
